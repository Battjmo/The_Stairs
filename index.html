        To be or not to be, that is the question
        Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrow of outrageous fortune
        or to take arms against a sea of troubles
        and by opposing end them
        to die
        to sleep
        no more
        and by sleep to say we end end to the heartache,
        and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to
        tis a consumation devoutly to be wished
        to die
        to sleep
        to sleep perchance to dream
        aye, there's the rub
        for in that sleep of death what dreams may come
        when we have shuffled off this mortal coil
        must give us pause
